Figure from Jung et. al. (2019) \nTo inform policy makers and practioners about the state of biodiversity, we need robust information on whether certain interventions and changes in behaviour might result in measurable differences in biodiversity outcomes. I regularly work with large global and national biodiversity databases and models and contribute towards making biodiversity indicators more robust and replicable. In particular I have investigated how we if and how we can establish linkages between local biodiversity change and remote sensing data, thus enabling cost-effective monitoring.\nKeywords: biotic-lag | remote sensing | indicators | model-based integration\nSelected manuscripts:\n\nJung, M.

In particular, it includes for the first time a representative set of about half of all plant species globally as well as above, below and soil organic carbon at risk from land use change. Different combinations of layers integrating biodiversity, carbon and/or water value are presented, based on the protected area network at the time (covering ~16% of terrestrial land area) or starting from a blank state. The maps highlight the upper potential value of any global terrestrial land area for conserving these valuable assets and presented as ranking from most (1) to least importance (100).\nInteractive Explorer | GEE Assets | Code | Data | Manuscript\n\n\nGlobal terrestrial and marine habitat mapping\n\n\n\nHabitatMaps\n\n\nUsing the Google Earth Engine platform I developed Javascript code to create the first global habitat map specifically for species habitat analyses. The map is created by intersecting best available global datasets on land cover, climate and land use. The code and map is released under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license and thus can be freely shared, used or modified. The most recent version of the habitat type layer is uploaded to Zenodo.\nTo run the code for creating the habitat type map an account on Google Earth Engine is necessary. No Python code was developed as part of this project. Note that while the code for the habitat type map is openly available, the underlying datasets (‘assets’ in Google Earth Engine) are not all (yet) publicly available. Assets can be shared depending on the request, however there is no guarantee that I will host all original input assets for long, since they might change as improved data becomes available.\nCode | Online Viewer | Data | Manuscript\n\n\nPotential distribution of land-cover classes\n\n\n\nPNV\n\n\nContributed to the creation of global openly available data on the Potential distribution of land cover classes (Potential Natural Vegetation) at 250 m spatial resolution based on a compilation of data sets (Biome6000k, Geo-Wiki, LandPKS, mangroves soil database, and from various literature sources; total of about 65,000 training points).

Such a clustering of homologous systems is necessarily coarse, while still being useful to identify possible leverage points for sustainable agriculture.\nThe data can be interactively explored and the layer is made openly downloaded here. Furthermore, as convenience, a layer further aggregated to reflect three levels of food production intensity is also provided in the same repository. A preprint describing the layer is currently in review.\nData | Manuscript"
