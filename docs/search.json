Figure from Jung et. al. (2019) \nTo inform policy makers and practioners about the state of biodiversity, we need robust information on whether certain interventions and changes in behaviour might result in measurable differences in biodiversity outcomes. I regularly work with large global and national biodiversity databases and models and contribute towards making biodiversity indicators more robust and replicable. In particular I have investigated how we if and how we can establish linkages between local biodiversity change and remote sensing data, thus enabling cost-effective monitoring.\nKeywords: biotic-lag | remote sensing | indicators | model-based integration\nSelected manuscripts:\n\nJung, M.

Figure from Jung et. al. (2021)  \nFunding for biodiversity is often limited and management for conservation or restoration has to be implemented in a way that is cost efficient and ideally beneficial to multiple assets, e.g. biodiversity as well as ecosystem services. I have used linear programming and optimization tools to derive delineations of global areas of importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services. I am expanding this work through ongoing projects, particular on onsidering further synergies and tradeoffs with Nature Constributions to People, integrating stakeholder preferences, and current and future land-use and climatic constrains.\nKeywords: conservation-planning | joint-optimization | spatial prioritization | integer programming\nSelected manuscripts:\n\nJung, M., André Alagador, D., Chapman, M., Hermoso, V., Kujala, H., O’Connor, L., Schinegger, R., Verburg, P.H. and Visconti.
