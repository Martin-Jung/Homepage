In most instances, political decisions and actions have to be undertaken today if we are improve the situation in the future. In terms of policy-advise this equates to the creation of (spatial-explicit) scenarios that highlight the costs and opportunities of actions that can be undertaken. Working at [IIASA](https://www.iiasa.ac.at) I have become increasingly interested and involved in the creation of biodiversity-relevant scenarios for policy advise.
