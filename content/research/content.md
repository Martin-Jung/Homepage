My scientific research broadly focusses on the nexus of land use, food production, biodiversity indicators and conservation planning.
Specifically, I am very much interested in
- **(a)** how we can bring the best-available biodiversity data into decision making processes and under which circumstances win-win situations arise.
- **(b)** the influence of temporal lags in our understanding of biodiversity change and effectiveness of conservation interventions.
- **(c)** providing scientists and practitioners with robust environmental datasets and accurate biodiversity indicators.
- **(d)** the creation of spatial and temporal scenarios and predictions of *what-if* assumptions and plausible future for humankind and wildlife on this planet.

I enjoy thinking about and implementing novel approaches to better quantify the natural and anthropic world. Here I regularly use and combine remote-sensing, ecological statistics and machine learning techniques.
