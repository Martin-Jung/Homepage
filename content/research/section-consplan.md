Given a limitation of funds, it is often a question where conservation management should be implemented to best benefit both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Recently I have used linear programming and optimization tools to derive delineations of cost-effective priorities. Through future projects I am looking forward to expand on this work, particular the intersection between mapping synergies and tradeoffs between stakeholder preferences, ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits.
