Funding for biodiversity is often limited and management for conservation or restoration has to be implemented in a way that is cost efficient and ideally beneficial to multiple assets, e.g. biodiversity as well as ecosystem services. I have used linear programming and optimization tools to derive delineations of global areas of importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Through future projects I am looking forward to expand on this work, particular the intersection between mapping synergies and tradeoffs between stakeholder preferences, land-use constrains, and the restoration of lost ecosystem service and biodiversity value.
