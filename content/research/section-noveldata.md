To make adequate decisions and quantify the influence of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystem services requires the best-available data. In various research projects I have led or been involved in creating new global and national datasets for the scientific community. Usually these data are created by either intersecting and harmonizing existing datasets or by applying innovative machine learning algorithms on remote-sensing imagery and climate variables. You can find some of the datasets that I created in the [Data](/software/#section-data) section.
