On the ground management and policy practitioners require robust information on whether interventions and changes in behaviour result in measurable differences in biodiversity. Working mainly with the [PREDICTS](http://www.predicts.org.uk/) and other global biodiversity databases I have investigated how we if and how we can establish linkages between local biodiversity change and remote sensing data, thus enabling cost-effective monitoring.
