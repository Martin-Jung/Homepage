abstract = "Despite increasing concerns about a loss of pollinators, there is little knowledge about how habitat fragmentation affects temperate plant-pollinators interactions. Here we investigate local habitat quality and landscape-wide effects of forest fragmentation on the specialization and diversity of quantitative temperate plant-pollinator networks. We sampled flower visitors along a forest cover and landscape context gradient in the last primeval forest of European lowland, in Białowieża (Eastern Poland). We hypothesized that diversity and specialization of plant-pollinator networks show hump-shaped reactions to intermediate levels of fragmentation, while on the local scale declining habitat quality influences the pollinator community composition and visitation rate. During 121 observation hours we sampled 4.929 flower visitors from 353 different pollinator species on 16 focal plant species. We found pollinator diversity to show a hump-shaped response to forest cover on the landscape level. However, plant specialization did not vary with forest cover but decreased with increasing flower abundance of con-specific plants in the vicinity of the focal plants. On the local scale overall pollinator visitation rate decreased with flower abundance, while diversity increased with a greater number of flowers. We furthermore found the pollinator communities per plant species to be influenced by canopy cover in the vicinity, while pooled communities per study site showed a significant relation to forest cover and focal plant diversity. We assume that additional floral resources in the vicinity are effectively used by pollinators and therefore the intensity of forest fragmentation effects is buffered. Forest pollinators seem to be capable of shifting their floral preferences to these additional resources in case of forest fragmentation. Patchy distributed floral resources and higher flower abundance in the vicinity may further stabilize pollination interactions in Białowieżas fragmented forest parts. This highlights the importance of local habitat quality for forest pollinators and might enhance future conservation measures. Our findings indicate that forest fragmentation effects at landscape level might be buffered by local habitat quality such as floral resources and nesting opportunities (to a certain extent)."
