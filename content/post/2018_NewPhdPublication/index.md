I can now happily announce that the first chapter of my PhD has been accepted and is going to be published in the Journal [Ecography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/16000587). In this piece I investigated whether pairwise compositional differences between species assemblages (so in the identity and amount of species found in a given place and time) can be explained by a dissimilarity in remotely-sensed vegetation index. <br>

I furthermore found that past dissimilarities in photosynthetic activity improved the overall fit relative to current dissimilarities, therefore hinting at a *lag-effect* that can be investigated via remote sensing. Also quite cool is that we use - to my knowledge for the first time - the same dissimilarity metric (the **Bray-Curtis** index) to quantify both differences between species assemblages and entire remotely-sensed time series of photosynthetic activity.
Terminology and writeup took quite a while for this piece, so I am quite happy that it is finally out.
