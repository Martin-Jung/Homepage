From the 1st of April 2019 onwards, I am now a postdoctoral Research Scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). At our institute we are commonly conducting policy-oriented research into problems of a global nature that are too large or too complex to be solved by a single country or academic discipline. Funded in the 70s as one of the first multi-national independent research institutes, it enabled researchers from the Former Soviet Union and the USA the opportunity to collaborate and work together despite political differences.

At IIASA I will specifically work in the context of the [NatureMap](naturemap.earth/) project, helping to develop new global integrated biodiversity, carbon and ecosystem services maps and modelsusing global data aggregation and optimisation routines.
