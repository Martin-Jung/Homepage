      <description>I perform most of my analyses using either R or standalone GDAL tools simply because of their general convenience and ease of use. Standard spatial analysis functions and tools are in my opinion still more readily available in R and most R packages are quite mature and well designed ( but see the readme ). Nevertheless python has caught up and a number of really helpful python modules for spatial analyses have been released to this date.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new starting website. My name is Martin Jung and I consider myself an Environmental and data scientist. Read here for more.
I have abandoned my previous online presence, the Conservation ecology blog since quite a while. Mostly because I was too preoccupied working on my PhD. However I also disliked the inflexibility of wordpress layouts and the added advertising below each wordpress.com article. Therefore the restart of my professional website powered by hugo and the academic theme.</description>
