      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can now happily announce that the first chapter of my PhD has been accepted and is going to be published in the Journal &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/16000587&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ecography&lt;/a&gt;. In this piece I investigated whether pairwise compositional differences between species assemblages (so in the identity and amount of species found in a given place and time) can be explained by a dissimilarity in remotely-sensed vegetation index. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I furthermore found that past dissimilarities in photosynthetic activity improved the overall fit relative to current dissimilarities, therefore hinting at a &lt;em&gt;lag-effect&lt;/em&gt; that can be investigated via remote sensing. Also quite cool is that we use - to my knowledge for the first time - the same dissimilarity metric (the &lt;strong&gt;Bray-Curtis&lt;/strong&gt; index) to quantify both differences between species assemblages and entire remotely-sensed time series of photosynthetic activity.
Terminology and writeup took quite a while for this piece, so I am quite happy that it is finally out.
\&lt;/p&gt;
