      <description>Anyone analysing big data (buzzword, here refereed to as data too big to load into memory) soon will come to the realization that processing such data requires a lot of computational resources. During my PhD I mainly worked with the local high-performance-computer (HPC) at the University of Sussex. A couple of years into my PhD and I increasingly realized that our little HPC suffers from the tragedy of the commons with more and more people requesting computation time on a few available nodes.</description>

      <description>I perform most of my analyses using either R or standalone GDAL tools simply because of their general convenience and ease of use. Standard spatial analysis functions and tools are in my opinion still more readily available in R and most R packages are quite mature and well designed ( but see the readme ). Nevertheless python has caught up and a number of really helpful python modules for spatial analyses have been released to this date.</description>

      <title>New professional website</title>

      <description>Welcome to my new starting website. My name is Martin Jung and I consider myself an Environmental and data scientist. Read here for more.
I have abandoned my previous online presence, the Conservation ecology blog since quite a while. Mostly because I was too preoccupied working on my PhD. However I also disliked the inflexibility of wordpress layouts and the added advertising below each wordpress.com article. Therefore the restart of my professional website powered by hugo and the academic theme.</description>
