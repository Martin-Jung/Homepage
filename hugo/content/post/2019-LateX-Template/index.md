This is a rather short post informing anyone who might read this post and is likely a Sussex PhD student (and presumably found this blog via google, hello google bot :-) ), that I created an <u>**unofficial**</u> template for Sussex PhD students. I ensured that the template is formatted as required by the Sussex doctoral school, however the template is provided **as is** and I am not liable for any errors or damages caused by using this template (see license in repository). I am not connected to the University of Sussex Doctoral School.

Here is the blank [pdf](https://github.com/Martin-Jung/Sussex_PhDThesis/blob/master/main.pdf) to see the output. Obviously format and structure can entirely be edited, but this obviously requires more in depth knowledge of TeX. I recommend using [overleaf](http://overleaf.com/) for writing.
The template itself might also be good as base to build your own template in case you are a PhD student from another University.
