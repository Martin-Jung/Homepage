Yet few globally representative studies explicitly consider such influences even though auxiliary data, such as from remote sensing, are readily available. Time series of satellite-derived data have been commonly used to quantify differences in land-surface attributes such as vegetation cover, which will among other things be influenced by anthropogenic land conversions and modifications. Here we quantify differences in current and past (up to five years before sampling) vegetation cover, and assess whether such differences differentially influence taxonomic and functional groups of species assemblages between spatial pairs of sites. Specifically, we correlated between-site dissimilarity in photosynthetic activity of vegetation (the Enhanced Vegetation Index) with the corresponding dissimilarity in local species assemblage composition from a global database using a common metric for both, the Bray-Curtis index. We found that dissimilarity in species assemblage composition was on average more influenced by dissimilarity in past than current photosynthetic activity, and that the influence of past dissimilarity increased when longer time periods were considered. Responses to past dissimilarity in photosynthetic activity also differed among taxonomic groups (plants, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), with reptiles being among the most influenced by more dissimilar past photosynthetic activity. Furthermore, we found that assemblages dominated by smaller and more vegetation-dependent species tended to be more influenced by dissimilarity in past photosynthetic activity than prey-dependent species. Overall, our results have implications for studies that investigate species responses to current environmental changes and highlight the importance of past changes continuing to influence local species assemblage composition. We demonstrate how local species assemblages and satellite-derived data can be linked and provide suggestions for future studies on how to assess the influence of past environmental changes on biodiversity.","tags":["biodiversity","remote-sensing","MODIS","PREDICTS"],"title":"Local species assemblages are influenced more by past than current dissimilarities in photosynthetic activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":["phd","remote-sensing","PREDICTS","biodiversity"],"content":"I can now happily announce that the first chapter of my PhD has been accepted and is going to be published in the Journal Ecography.

Also quite cool is that we use - to my knowledge for the first time - the same dissimilarity metric (the Bray-Curtis index) to quantify both differences between species assemblages and entire remotely-sensed time series of photosynthetic activity.

My dream setup would include to being able to switch seamless between running r code locally or in the cloud whenever I require more processing power. For instance similar doAzureParallel package available for Microsoft Azure. For Google cloud engine, there also exists a neat package called googleComputeEngineR, that allows to easily setup a virtual machine and run code remotely. So let\u0026rsquo;s setup the googleComputeEngineR package. As always, please note you alone (the dear reader) is responsible to keep track of your virtual machines in the cloud. If you do not stop them (i.e. shut them down), then this will cost you money!  In order to use the googleComputeEngineR package, we first need to create a credentials file. For my google cloud project and personal linux machine I have created such a file on my local system like this:\n# Create the file touch ~/.Renviron echo \u0026quot;GCE_AUTH_FILE=\\\u0026quot;~/wasserdampf.json\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.Renviron echo \u0026quot;GCE_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=\\\u0026quot;wolke7-208420\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.Renviron echo \u0026quot;GCE_DEFAULT_ZONE=\\\u0026quot;us-central1-a\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.Renviron  One also needs a service account auth key (here called wasserdampf.json).

While it is possible to run large spatial operations on google cloud compute, it is quite time-consuming to set up all the routines to load and process geospatial data. Luckily there is now a new platform (currently in beta-testing) called Google Earth Engine (GEE) described as planetary scale platform for spatial analyses. GEE is (currently) free to use and users can sign up for a beta-testing. There are a wide range of datasets already available within GEE, including all available Landsat, Sentinel and MODIS satellite data. GEE furthermore allows to pre-process these layers and the fantastatic google team also already pre-computed layers such as cloud masks or ingested fully radiometrically corrected layers. If the reader is interested in what is possible with GEE, have a look at the case studies on the GEE website.  In the rest of this post I will showcase some exemplary scripts I coded in Javascript which, besides python, is the primary way to access and pre-process data in GEE. I will mostly only comment on my script as there are extensive tutorials, videos and detailed API descriptions available for GEE. Whenever I load outside data (such as ESRI shapefiles) into GEE, I usually convert them to a KML file and then load them as Google Fusion Table (search online how to do this). All the (java-)scripts below can be pasted into the GEE code console, but if any errors occur then usually because of missing permissions (you might not be able to access my Google Fusion Tables). The following script quantifies the date of forest loss from the Hansen forest cover dataset\n// Load the global Hansen forest dataset var gfcImage = ee.Image(\u0026quot;UMD/hansen/global_forest_change_2017_v1_5\u0026quot;); /* @author Martin Jung - m.jung@sussex.ac.uk Idea: Get average date of forest loss within sampling extent */ // Coordinates and parameters // (This is a fusiontable id containing my polygon shapefile) var fullsites = ee.FeatureCollection('ft:1Oet2yGWvldNoVx8A6ZlCi75Ks_lrEG0dG9oD6k2j'); // All sites //////// Other Parameters ////////// var export_geometry = false; // export the geometry in the csv var scale = 30; // Resolution over which image collection should be reduced, 30 m = native scale var reduce = ee.Reducer.mean() // Reducer for image collection // Also available max(), mean(), median(), min(), mode(), or(), product(), sum(), stdDev() var what = \u0026quot;ForestLoss\u0026quot;; // Export name // ################################################################### // // Function and main CODE starts here // // ################################################################### // // Create TimeBand function createTimeBand(image) { return image.addBands(image.metadata('system:time_start')); } // ---- // // Select the band with loss year var forestImage = gfcImage.select(['lossyear']); // Mask out pixels with no lossyear var m = forestImage.gt(0); forestImage = forestImage.mask(m); // -------------------------------- // // Reduce per polygon per polygon var extracted = forestImage.reduceRegions(fullsites, reduce, scale); Export.table.toDrive({ collection: extracted.select([\u0026quot;.*\u0026quot;], null, export_geometry), description: \u0026quot;PREDICTSHansen_\u0026quot;+what, fileNamePrefix: \u0026quot;PREDICTSHansen_\u0026quot;+what, fileFormat: 'geoJSON' });  \nNot too difficult, right? Here is another script that calculates a 95 % percentile composite of three months of EVI data calculated from all available Landsat surface reflectance images from 1984 to 2017. My script furthermore exclude all pixels that are clearly covered by water (using data from Pekel et al. 2016 ) and mask out unsuitable images (too many clouds) as well as clouds and cloud-shadows.

During my PhD I mainly worked with the local high-performance-computer (HPC) at the University of Sussex. A couple of years into my PhD and I increasingly realized that our little HPC suffers from the tragedy of the commons with more and more people requesting computation time on a few available nodes. That and also the tendency to have limited flexibility for running customized code (no root access, outdated modules and libraries, little space on the home drive to set up virtual environments, etc. \u0026hellip;) has made me quite frustrated and willing to switch to the \u0026ldquo;Cloud\u0026rdquo; for accessing computing resources. Cloud computing these days is well established, but mainly concentrated in the hands of three leading US firms. As far as I am aware one basically has to choose between Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud programs. Each have their own benefits and I leave it to the reader to search elsewhere for information on which one to chose. I picked the Google cloud free trial offer partly because of the following reasons:\n They have a 300$ give away. (I think Microsoft and Amazon offer sth. similar though)\n The free trial period lasts 12 months after which it runs out without incurring further cost. Furthermore there will remain a free-use contingent which can be exhausted for free. You fire up some use time on a f1-micro VM for instance.\n I am increasingly using Google\u0026rsquo;s Earth Engine platform and plan to use Google cloud storage to enhance my workflow.\n Private 1GB Git hosting (now especially useful since Competitor Microsoft has acquired Github )\n  That being said, I have also heard great things about AWS and Azure as well and might try them out at a later point as well.\n So here is how I started. My goal was to first get familiar with computing in the cloud and try to install some standard tools. Therefore First I fired up a micro instance Virtual Machine (which, in the google cloud, you can run over 700h each month for free). On the SSH button you have the opportunity to directly log into your cloud instance in the browser or in another ssh-client of you choosing. Each VM can be selected and also started / stopped or completly reseted in this screen as well (also via the \u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; button!) I\u0026rsquo;m going to install some basic data-science tools. Here is the entire thing as bash-script to be executed on the next, bigger, VM in a later stage ;-)\n# First lets install some necessary libraries sudo apt-get -y install bzip2 sudo apt-get -y install screen # Make a update and upgrade all, then clean up sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get -y upgrade sudo apt-get -y autoremove # Make download folder mkdir downloads cd downloads # Download anaconda wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh # Install in the background (accept and updating any previous installations) bash Anaconda2-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -u -p $HOME/anaconda2 echo \u0026quot;export PATH=\\\u0026quot;~/anaconda2/bin:$PATH\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc # Reload conf source ~/.bashrc # Install R # Add debian stretch repo and key, then install echo \u0026quot;deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/debian stretch-cran35/\u0026quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 'E19F5F87128899B192B1A2C2AD5F960A256A04AF' sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y r-base r-base-core r-base-dev sudo apt-get install -y libatlas3-base # Also install rstudio keyserver sudo apt-get -y install psmisc libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssh2-1-dev wget https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-stretch-1.1.453-amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i rstudio-server-stretch-1.1.453-amd64.deb # Also install julia for later sudo apt-get -y install julia  Note to myself: For the future it might be easier to configure an analysis-ready docker image.

Standard spatial analysis functions and tools are in my opinion still more readily available in R and most R packages are quite mature and well designed ( but see the readme ). Nevertheless python has caught up and a number of really helpful python modules for spatial analyses have been released to this date. I have always loved coding in python since I developed my LecoS plugin, especially because of it\u0026rsquo;s processing speed (doing any computation on numpy arrays is quite fun) and clean synthax. In this post I will demonstrate how to make use of the new (?) xarray (previously xray) python module to load remotely-sensed data and run \u0026ldquo;pixel-wise\u0026rdquo; correlation tests on them.\nI cannot release the shown spatial data, however any \u0026lsquo;stack\u0026rsquo; of remotely-sensed data or multiple satellite images will do as long as you can assign a time dimension/axis to the array.\nAll python modules should be easible downloadable via the package manager of your choice such as wheel, pip and conda \u0026amp; co.\n So what is xarray? In short it is a python package that enables explicit computation on labeled, multi-dimensional arrays, such as those commonly obtained from geophysical models or repeated satellite images. Think of it as a convenience wrapper that combines the best of pandas data structures with numpy\u0026rsquo;s array functionalities. It has been developed specifically with geophysical applications in mind and therefore should be quite useful for anyone using such data.\nLoading and plotting data So how does it work? Let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\nFirst load the default packages that we are going to use later.\n# Necessary defaults import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy import stats import pandas as pd import os, sys # Xarray import xarray as xr  Next let us load some spatial data. In my example it is a stack of annual Landsat composite images created for the period 1984-2017. Each composite quantifies the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) for a given year. My test data is roughly 100mB big, but all code presented can easily be scaled up to hundreds of GB. In the newest xarray version we can use the fantastic rasterio python interface to load commonly-used spatial data such as GeoTiffs.\nroute = \u0026quot;test_2063.tif\u0026quot; ds = xr.open_rasterio(route).rename({'x': 'Longitude', 'y': 'Latitude', 'band': 'year'})  Spatial-temporal satellite data comes with at least 3 dimensions. The spatial dimensions describing the rows and columns of the matrix as well as a third dimension usually associated with time (year, year-month, date, \u0026hellip;). xarray furthermore loads any spatial attributes (such as spatial extents, cell resolution or geographic projections) it can find and assigns them to the DataArray. Here is how my data looks: (note the attributes!)\n\u0026lt;xarray.DataArray (year: 34, Latitude: 1318, Longitude: 1555)\u0026gt; [69682660 values with dtype=float32] Coordinates: * year (year) int64 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ... * Latitude (Latitude) float64 32.6 32.6 32.6 32.6 32.6 32.6 32.6 32.6 ... * Longitude (Longitude) float64 -87.94 -87.94 -87.94 -87.94 -87.94 -87.94 ... Attributes: transform: (-87.9403950755027, 0.0002694945852365922, 0.0, 32.599951492... crs: +init=epsg:4326 res: (0.0002694945852365922, 0.00026949458523998555) is_tiled: 0 nodatavals: (-3.4e+38, -3.4e+38, -3.4e+38, -3.4e+38, -3.4e+38, -3.4e+38,...  We are going to the data and try to create a spatial visualization. xarray has inbuilt plotting capabilities to visualize both temporal and spatial data using matplotlib. In my example I first alter the temporal dimension to have the correct time axis. I furthermore convert my xarray DataArray to a DataSet (more here on the difference ) and also filter the array to encorporate only positive values.\n# Create a series with years dates = pd.date_range('1984-01-01', periods=34,freq = \u0026quot;A\u0026quot;).year ds.coords[\u0026quot;year\u0026quot;] = dates # Reset dates ds = ds.to_dataset(\u0026quot;EVI\u0026quot;) # Convert to dataset # Create a subset to run calcution on and correct scale + filter img = ds.pipe(lambda x: x * 0.0001) img = img.where(img \u0026gt;= 0) # Select the last item of year and plot it img.isel(year=33).EVI.plot(robust=True,cmap='viridis') # Finally plot a test year plt.title('Annual EVI in year %s' % ('2017') ) plt.ylabel('Latitude') plt.xlabel('Longitude')  Basic and applied calculations Next let us conduct some spatial-temporal analyses. The xarray created above can in principle easily be summarized as a whole or on the pixel level. Both can be easily achieved by grouping observations on the pixel level.\nds2.EVI.groupby('year').std().plot()  Equally if we want to quantify the standard deviation across all 34 years in the stack\nds2.EVI.groupby('Longitude','Latitude').std('year').plot()  But what if want to apply a defined method over each pixel in given xarray? This is again possible, but a little bit more complicated. First we need to define a function that performs the requested analysis and returns a single value. In my example I want to calculate Kendall\u0026rsquo;s rank correlation test for each time series over all pixels. Remember how we imported the scipy stats package at the start of this post? To save time and harddrive space, we simply want to know for this simple example whether EVI is \u0026ldquo;significantly\u0026rdquo; ($p = 0.05$) increasing over the whole time series. So let us build a function: def k_cor(x,y, pthres = 0.05, direction = True): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Uses the scipy stats module to calculate a Kendall correlation test :x vector: Input pixel vector to run tests on :y vector: The date input vector :pthres: Significance of the underlying test :direction: output only direction as output (-1 \u0026amp; 1) \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; # Check NA values co = np.count_nonzero(~np.isnan(x)) if co \u0026lt; 4: # If fewer than 4 observations return -9999 return -9999 # Run the kendalltau test tau, p_value = stats.kendalltau(x, y) # Criterium to return results in case of Significance if p_value \u0026lt; pthres: # Check direction if direction: if tau \u0026lt; 0: return -1 elif tau \u0026gt; 0: return 1 else: return tau else: return 0 # The function we are going to use for applying our kendal test per pixel def kendall_correlation(x,y,dim='year'): # x = Pixel value, y = a vector containing the date, dim == dimension return xr.apply_ufunc( k_cor, x , y, input_core_dims=[[dim], [dim]], vectorize=True, # !Important! output_dtypes=[int] )  Next we execute our new function and to do so we first need to create a new DataArray that contains the y variable (date in our example). Afterwards we can apply our function on the loaded xarray.\nx = xr.DataArray(np.arange(len(ds2['year']))+1, dims='year', coords={'year': ds2['year']}) r = kendall_correlation(ds2, x,'year')  This whole computation took us roughly 1min and 54 seconds on my Lenovo laptop.\nFurther speed ups In many cases an execution on a local computer hardly makes sense and is time inefficient. Particularly if your data is too large to fit into memory. This is usually the case with earth-observation data, which can easily become larger than 10GB++ .\nLuckily xarray supports parallel execution via the optional Dask integration. So what is dask? Compared to standard numpy array calculations it supports lazy evaluation of any supplied code. This means that your code is only executed on the dataset as soon as you tell dask+xarray to do so (via the compute() function ). Dask divides your array into many small pieces, so called chunks, each of which is presumed to be small enough to fit into memory. Chunking your data enables better parallelization which can easily be scaled up over multiple CPU cores or entire clusters of machines. So how do we enable dask for your computation ? This is actually quite simple.\n# Import dask stuff import dask.array as da from dask.diagnostics import ProgressBar # Then while loading in your data specify that you want your data to be loaded as chunks # A more optimal chunk size for your data can really speed up computation # So ensure that your dataset is correctly chuncked. ds = xr.open_rasterio(route,chunks={'band': 34, 'x': 1000, 'y': 1000}).rename({'x': 'Longitude', 'y': 'Latitude', 'band': 'year' })  You will notice that your DataArray has now become a dask-array\n\u0026lt;xarray.DataArray (year: 34, Latitude: 1318, Longitude: 1555)\u0026gt; dask.array\u0026lt;shape=(34, 1318, 1555), dtype=float32, chunksize=(34, 100, 100)\u0026gt; ...  Next you have to enable dask in your apply function and compute the result\ndef kendall_correlation(x,y,dim='year'): return xr.apply_ufunc( mk_cor, x , y, input_core_dims=[[dim], [dim]], vectorize=True, dask='parallelized', # Note the addition !!! output_dtypes=[int] ) # Make a little ProgressBar with ProgressBar(): # Until 'compute' is run, no computation is executed r = kendall_correlation(ds2, x,'year').compute()  Running my computation with dask decreased the whole processing time down to 45s !\nBut there is more we can do to further speed up the computation. By enabling numba as just-in-time (JIT) byte compiler for our kendall correlation function we can squeeze a couple more seconds out. Numba compiles your python function into a byte-compiled snip that is a lot faster to execute. One can enable the JIT compiler as follows:\nfrom numba import jit # Speedup for python functions @jit(nogil=True) # Enable JIT compiler def k_cor(x,y, pthres = 0.05, direction = True): ...  Note all this was run on a rather small dataset. The more data you have and the more computational intensive your analysis becomes, the more do the steps above improve your execution time.\nMy system info:\n Linux Ubuntu - Codename bionic Python 3.6.5 Numpy 1.13.3 Xarray 0.10.2 dask 0.16.0 numba 0.34.0  Full source code as gist\n ","date":1526943600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526943600,"objectID":"f5584c7cea8b7e65f29bf72c8bf2a317","permalink":"http://martin-jung.github.io/post/2018-xarrayregression/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-xarrayregression/","section":"post","summary":"I perform most of my analyses using either R or standalone GDAL tools simply because of their general convenience and ease of use.

Slowing rates of deforestation is a conservation priority, but it is also useful to consider how species diversity is retained across the agricultural matrix. Here, we assess how bird diversity varies in relation to land use in the Taita Hills, Kenya. We used point counts to survey birds along a landâuse gradient that included primary forest, secondary vegetation, agroforest, timber plantation and cropland. We found that the agricultural matrix supports an abundant and diverse bird community with high levels of species turnover, but that forest specialists are confined predominantly to primary forest, with the matrix dominated by forest visitors. Ordination analyses showed that representation of forest specialists decreases with distance from primary forest. With the exception of forest generalists, bird abundance and diversity are lowest in timber plantations. Contrary to expectation, we found feeding guilds at similar abundances in all landâuse types. We conclude that whilst the agricultural matrix, and agroforest in particular, makes a strong contribution to observed bird diversity at the landscape scale, intact primary forest is essential for maintaining this diversity, especially amongst species of conservation concern.

Biodiversity models can be useful tools to inform policymakers and conservationists of the likely response of species to anthropogenic pressures, including landâuse change. However, such models generalize biodiversity responses across wide areas and many taxa, potentially missing important characteristics of particular sites or clades. Comparisons of biodiversity models with independently collected field data can help us understand the local factors that mediate broadâscale responses. We collected independent bird occurrence and abundance data along two elevational transects in Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania and the Taita Hills, Kenya. We estimated the local response to land use and compared our estimates with modelled local responses based on a large database of many different taxa across Africa. To identify the local factors mediating responses to land use, we compared environmental and species assemblage information between sites in the independent and Africanâwide datasets. Bird species richness and abundance responses to land use in the independent data followed similar trends as suggested by the Africanâwide biodiversity model, however the landâuse classification was too coarse to capture fully the variability introduced by local agricultural management practices. A comparison of assemblage characteristics showed that the sites on Kilimanjaro and the Taita Hills had higher proportions of forest specialists in croplands compared to the Africaâwide average. Local human population density, forest cover and vegetation greenness also differed significantly between the independent and Africaâwide datasets. Biodiversity models including those variables performed better, particularly in croplands, but still could not accurately predict the magnitude of local species responses to most land uses, probably because local features of the land management are still missed. Overall, our study demonstrates that local factors mediate biodiversity responses to land use and cautions against applying biodiversity models to local contexts without prior knowledge of which factors are locally relevant.

Using data from previously published studies we modelled the impacts of forest age and climate on BD using linear mixed effects models. We examined the potential biases in the dataset by comparing how representative it was of global mature forests in terms of its distribution, the climate space it occupied, and the ages of the forests used. BD increased with forest age, mean annual temperature and annual precipitation. Importantly, the effect of forest age increased with increasing temperature, but the effect of precipitation decreased with increasing temperatures. The dataset was biased towards northern hemisphere forests in relatively dry, cold climates. The dataset was also clearly biased towards forests ","tags":["forests","carbon","modelling"],"title":"Can we set a global threshold age to define mature forests?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"0660f9bbc7782b7a4c2a49e8204daa47","permalink":"http://martin-jung.github.io/talk/2016_sussexgittalk/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2016_sussexgittalk/","section":"talk","summary":"I gave a short presentation of the merits of using github for collaboration and archiving","tags":["coding","reproducability","data"],"title":"2016 Introducing github at University of Sussex","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Martin Jung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"f7e0f2b14c50863a4397bfd05d0f2c80","permalink":"http://martin-jung.github.io/publication/2016_lecos/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_lecos/","section":"publication","summary":"The quantification of landscape structures from remote-sensing products is an important part of many analyses in landscape ecology studies.

Land use change is one of the largest threats to biodiversity conservation. Despite this realisation, our understanding of what aspects and how land use/land cover (LULC) changes impact biodiversity is relatively limited. This PhD project will use the largest, global database on matched biodiversity observationsâcontaining over 2 million records representing 35,000 species from 20,000 sites across 88 countries (www.predicts.org.uk)âand combine this with freely-available, long-term satellite data of LULC change (e.g. MODIS, Landsat), to understand which aspects of LULC change are most important to determine biodiversity outcomes. Such understanding will allow projecting biodiversity outcomes in space and time, and guide LULC decisions to minimize biodiversity impacts. Past ecological research on LULC change has focussed mostly on single events, and mostly on conversions from natural to human-dominated lands, e.g. deforestation, cropland expansion. However, in reality human use of land is a dynamic process of LULC changing and alternating through time. In particular, once natural lands are converted they tend to cycle through various human uses, abandonment, and sometimes regrowth. Time-series of remotely-sensed imagery enable us to study the frequency, sequence, time span and magnitude of LULC changes for most locations on the Earthâs surface. Different types and transitions of LULC will have different impacts on biodiversity, e.g. changing wheat to barley may be equivalent for some species, whereas changing forest to pasture may not. Further, some impacts on biodiversity of land use dynamics can be observed immediately, e.g. for sessile species, whereas other species tend to show a temporal lag in response, e.g. for species that can disperse. Combining best available global biodiversity and remotely-sensed data we will investigate which aspects of LULC dynamics, such as habitat stability, shocks (e.g. fire, drought, deforestation), phenological shifts, are important to determine biodiversity outcomes, and also investigate species-energy relationships. This understanding will help plan conservation actions, e.g. by altering the sequence of LULC changes more or less biodiversity may be conserved; allow extrapolation of biodiversity impacts in space and time; and ultimately feed into policy processes, such as the reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity and IPBES.\nObjectives and core chapters  Investigate if past differences in land use and land cover can explain current differences in local species assemblages Quantifying the general impact of past disturbance events on local species assemblages Assess if differing histories of land changes drive species assemblage assembly Investigate whether changes in local biodiversity are correlated with landscape-wide land changes  ","date":1442275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1442275200,"objectID":"c9a66b2d3f935438f991c02f81127b35","permalink":"http://martin-jung.github.io/project/phd/","publishdate":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"Short summary of the research aims for my PhD thesis","tags":["phd-thesis"],"title":"My PhD research aims","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lawrence N Hudson"," Tim Newbold"," Sara Contu"," Samantha LL Hill"," Igor Lysenko"," Adriana De Palma"," Helen RP Phillips"," Rebecca A Senior","[...]"," Martin Jung","[...]","JÃ¶rn P.

Existing global databases of speciesâ threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project â and avert â future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of localâscale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1% of the described species within many taxonomic groups â including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems â www.predicts.org.uk). We make siteâlevel summary data available alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in 2015.

Here we investigate local habitat quality and landscape-wide effects of forest fragmentation on the specialization and diversity of quantitative temperate plant-pollinator networks. We sampled flower visitors along a forest cover and landscape context gradient in the last primeval forest of European lowland, in BiaÅowieÅ¼a (Eastern Poland). We hypothesized that diversity and specialization of plant-pollinator networks show hump-shaped reactions to intermediate levels of fragmen- tation, while on the local scale declining habitat quality influences the pollinator community composition and visitation rate. During 121 observation hours we sampled 4.929 flower visitors from 353 different pollinator species on 16 focal plant species. We found pollinator diversity to show a hump-shaped response to forest cover on the landscape level. However, plant specialization did not vary with forest cover but decreased with increasing flower abundance of con-specific plants in the vicinity of the focal plants. On the local scale overall pollinator visitation rate decreased with flower abundance, while diversity increased with a greater number of flowers. We furthermore found the pollinator communities per plant species to be influenced by canopy cover in the vicinity, while pooled communities per study site showed a significant relation to forest cover and focal plant diversity. We assume that additional floral resources in the vicinity are effectively used by pollina- tors and therefore the intensity of forest fragmentation effects is buffered. Forest pollinators seem to be capable of shifting their floral preferences to these additional resources in case of forest fragmentation. Patchy distributed floral resources and higher flower abundance in the vicinity may further stabilize pollination interactions in BiaÅowieÅ¼as fragmented forest parts. This highlights the importance of local habitat quality for forest pollinators and might enhance future conservation measures. Our findings indicate that forest fragmentation effects at landscape level might be buffered by local habitat quality such as floral resources and nesting opportunities (to a certain extent).","tags":["ecology","thesis","plant-pollinator","networks","fieldwork"],"title":"Influence of Forest Fragmentation on Temperate Plant-pollinator Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Jung","Felix GaÃner","Lars GorschlÃ¼ter","Karin LamsfuÃ"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1330560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1330560000,"objectID":"95ff483a008dbcc97860183031e2f528","permalink":"http://martin-jung.github.io/publication/2012_save-palmoil-report/","publishdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_save-palmoil-report/","section":"publication","summary":"Report written pro-bono for the SAVE Wildlife foundation (https://save-wildlife.org)","tags":["palmoil","africa","conservation"],"title":"The U.S. investors and African palm oil - Rainforest clearing and local resistance in West Cameroon","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"d0b8106eeaa06ef9b48290189244bac0","permalink":"http://martin-jung.github.io/project/lecos/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/lecos/","section":"project","summary":"LecoS - Land cover statistics is plugin for the QGIS GIS software suite.
