                <p>Welcome to my personal landing page in the web!<br>

                My name is Martin Jung and I am an aspiring next-generation ecologist.
                <p>
                    I did my BSc Thesis in Biology at the <a href="http://uni-marburg.de/">University of Marburg</a>, Germany, in which I investigated the response of temperate plant-pollinator networks towards forest fragmentation. Afterwards I moved to Denmark, where I wrote my MSc thesis at the <a href="http://macroecology.ku.dk/">Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate</a> investigating the congruence between a broad-scale biodiversity model and independent field data. This september I am going to start a PhD in Environmental Science at the <a href="http://sussex.ac.uk/">University of Sussex</a>, United Kingdom. 
                </p>                
                <p>
                    I am broadly interested in Ecology and Conservation and have a personal taxonomic background in ornithology and entomology. My current research is focussed on the interplay between macroecology and natural resource management in the face of global change.
