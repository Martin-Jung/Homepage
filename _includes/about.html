                <p>Welcome to my personal landing page in the web!<br>
                My name is Martin Jung and I am an aspiring next-generation ecologist.
                <p>
                    I am a PhD researcher in Environmental Science at the <a href="http://sussex.ac.uk/">University of Sussex</a>, United Kingdom. In my PhD I will move to a global point of view and continue investigating the influence of anthropogenic drivers, such as land-use, on biodiversity across space and time. Specifically I will analyse large spatial-temporal remote-sensing products and combine this with the best biodiversity models currently available.
                </p>

                    I did my Bachelors at the <a href="http://uni-marburg.de/">University of Marburg</a>, Germany, in which I investigated the response of temperate plant-pollinator networks towards forest fragmentation. For my thesis I conducted over three months of fieldwork in one of the last patches of remaining "primary" forest in Europe, the <a href="http://www.npbp.brest.by/">Białowieża National Park</a>, Poland.

                <p>
                    Afterwards I moved to Denmark, where I wrote my MSc thesis at the <a href="http://macroecology.ku.dk/">Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate</a> investigating the congruence between a broad-scale biodiversity model and independent field data.  For my thesis I combined a meta-analytical approach and on-the-ground field work, where I sampled bird communities across a band of different land-use intensities for two and a half months in the <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/science/taita/taitahills.html">Taita hills</a>, Kenya and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a>, Tanzania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am broadly interested in Ecology and Conservation and have a personal taxonomic background in ornithology and entomology. My current research is focussed on the interplay between macroecology and natural resource management in the face of global change.
